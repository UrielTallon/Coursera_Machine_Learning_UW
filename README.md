## Coursera Specialization - Machine Learning

This repository contains the work made for the Coursera specialization on Machine Learning offered by the
__University  of Washington__. The course focuses on different case studies to explain the intricacies of
different machine learning techniques and algorithms.

The course consists in an introduction course, 4 different modules and a capstone project. In this repository
I will only store the work pertaining to the 4 modules and the capstone project:

* __Module 1:__ Regression
* __Module 2:__ Classification
* __Module 3:__ Clustering & Information Retrieval
* __Module 4:__ Recommender Systems & Dimensionality Reduction

At the time, only the work on module 1 is partially recorded.
